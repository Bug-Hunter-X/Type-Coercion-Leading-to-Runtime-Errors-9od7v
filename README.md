This code demonstrates a common issue in TypeScript where type coercion can lead to runtime errors that are not caught during compilation. The `add` function is declared to accept two numbers, but the code calls it with a number and a string. TypeScript does not throw an error, leading to unexpected behavior.  The solution shows how to use type guards or type assertions to prevent this issue and make the code more robust.
